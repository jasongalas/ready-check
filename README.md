Are you ready? âœ…

## Description

We had a vision for creating an app where you can gather the people in your life around the activities that you have in common with them. Inspired by gaming with your friends who may not be in the same timezone, we wanted to reach spaces beyond merely gaming. Without having to create endless group chats, Instagram chats, and every other messaging app to corral people together, we created the Ready Check. Our open ended inputs allow our users to create all sorts of events, and by sharing them with their friends, they can experience them together. 

## Installation

No installation is required for this app to function. You only need to create an account at [readyCheck](https://ready-check.onrender.com) to get started!

## Usage

Once you create your account with ReadyCheck, you'll be directed to our home page. If you click into the profile page, you can update your bio here and introduce yourself to the world. Your ready checks will also live on this page under recent activity. You can also set your own custom status to let other users know what you're up to, your availablity, or however you're feeling. Once you're satisfied with the information in your profile, you can hop over to the social page so you can follow your friends, family, and loved ones to grow your circles. Now, say you're getting ready to hop online and play DOTA 2? You can then create a new ReadyCheck and send it to your DOTA 2 playing friends to play alongside you. You want to go out into Golden Gate park to explore? Make a ready check and meet your homies there! If you make a mistake, that's ok, as all your readychecks are editable, and deletable as needed.

## Credits

A huge shout to Drew and Kyle for all of the assistance in getting ReadyCheck up and running. We simply could not have done it without their help and dedication to the craft of coding. Also to this group for perservering in the face of insurmountable odds. This is thanks to each of you.
